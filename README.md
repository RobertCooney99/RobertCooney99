Hello! I'm Rob Cooney, a software engineer and graphic designer from the UK.

I started to teach myself programming at the age of 10 and carried that on through my education, most recently completing a Computer Science BSc degree at the University of Warwick, with a dissertation project focused on software engineering. Throughout that time I have experience with a wide range of languages, notably with the following: Java, Python, C++, JavaScript/TypeScript, React, HTML, CSS, MySQL/SQL, NoSQL, Apache Kafka, Apache Hadoop/Hive.
